# Virtual Element Methods

This repository contains a Python translation of the code provided in:

>[The virtual element method in 50 lines of MATLAB. *Oliver J. Sutton*. *Numerical Algorithms*](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11075-016-0235-3)

It solves a toy problem, a 2-D poisson equation on generalized polygonal meshes, using the lowest order Virtual Element Methods.


## Usage

```
$ python3 vem.py --help
usage: vem.py [-h] [-d D] [-o O] [--save_plot] [--title TITLE] i

This script solves 2-D Poisson Equation on general polygonal meshes using
Virtual Element Methods of the lowest order.

positional arguments:
  i              Path to input mesh

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  -d D           Specifies the shape of the 2D domain.
                 Possible values are:
                 - s: Square Domain
                 - l: L-Shaped Domain
  -o O           Path to output file
  --save_plot    Flag for saving the plot
  --title TITLE  Title of plot
```

The meshes can be downloaded from [here](http://www.netlib.org/numeralgo/) (available in the na45 package). A copy of the meshes is also provided in this repository in the `meshes` directory.


### Example Usage

```
$ Computing the solution of a 2-D poisson equation on a square mesh and square domain
python3 vem.py -d s meshes/square -o solution.npy --save_plot --title plot.png
```

## Some Results

Since this is a translation of the paper, this repository solved the exact toy problem that the paper has taken up, that is,

![problem](assets/problem.png "Problem")
![rhs](assets/rhs.png "RHS")
![boundary](assets/boundary.png "boundary")

The solutions to this problem on different meshes in the square domain are shown below.

| **Mesh** | Square | Triangle | Voronoi | Smoothed Voronoi | Non-convex |
| -------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **Solution** | <img src="assets/plots/u_sd_s.png" width=1200px /> | <img src="assets/plots/u_sd_t.png" width=1200px /> | <img src="assets/plots/u_sd_v.png" width=1200px /> | <img src="assets/plots/u_sd_sv.png" width=1200px /> | <img src="assets/plots/u_sd_nc.png" width=1200px /> |


## Custom boundary conditions and RHS

You can customise the code to run it with your own boundary condition and RHS too!

Just take a look at `square_domain_boundary_condition` and `square_domain_rhs`, you can write similar boundary condition functions and RHS function definitions. 

Basically, your the template is as follows:

```
# for boundary condition
def my_boundary_condition(points):
	# points is a list of 2-lists, containing mesh points

	results = do_something(points)
	return results

# for RHS
def my_rhs(point):
    # here we have a single 2-list as input

    result_rhs = do_something_more(point)
    return result_rhs
```

Now, in `vem.py`, go to the main function where the `vem` function is called and change it to:

```
u = vem(mesh_file, my_rhs, my_boundary_condition)
```

And voil√†! You should be good to go!
